Description: The GPrank package implements a Gaussian-process-based
    ranking method which can be used to rank multiple time series
    according to their temporal activity levels. An example is the
    case when expression levels of all genes are measured over time
    and the main concern is to identify the most active genes,
    i.e. genes which show significant non-random variation in their
    expression levels. GPrank computes Bayes factors for each time
    series by comparing the marginal likelihoods under time-dependent
    and time-independent Gaussian process models. Under the assumption
    of smooth temporal behaviour, time dependency is modelled with rbf
    kernel, and noise is assumed to be white. GPrank incorporates
    uncertainty levels of the observations into the GP models, which
    makes ranking more robust against internal and external factors
    varying from time to time due to the nature of the experiment.
    GPrank also creates an SQLite database for displaying the GP
    profiles on a browser for visualisation, filtering or ranking
    purposes.
