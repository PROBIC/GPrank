Description: Implements a Gaussian-process-based ranking method
    which can be used to rank multiple time series according to
    their temporal activity levels. An example is the case when
    expression levels of all genes are measured over a time course
    and the main concern is to identify the most active genes, i.e.
    genes which show significant non-random variation in their
    expression levels. This is achieved by computing Bayes factors
    for each time series by comparing the marginal likelihoods under
    time-dependent and time-independent Gaussian process models.Under
    the assumption of smooth temporal behaviour, time dependency is
    captured with radial basis function kernel, and noise is assumed
    to be white. Furthermore, additional variance information from
    pre-processing of the observations are incorporated into the
    GP models, which makes ranking more robust against internal and
    external factors varying from time to time due to the nature of
    the experiment. In addition, an SQLite database file can be
    created for displaying the GP profiles on a browser for
    visualisation, filtering or ranking purposes.
